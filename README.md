# Animal Adoption
Animal Adoption is a web application I have developed as part of college project, with Angular 15.2 + Bootstrap + json-server. It features a simple interface where visitors can browse an animal catalog, learn more about each animal, and complete an adoption process. Rather than focus on aesthetical appearance, I chose to implement robust

## Instructions

1. Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js installed, by executing `node -v` inside your terminal. **Note**: you may or may not need to globally install Angular. Should you run into problems during later steps, run
```bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Inside the project's root directory, execute the following command:
```bash
npm install
```
4. You are now ready to serve the application locally. Simply run this:
```
ng serve
```
5. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:4200/. You should now see the Animal Adoption application running.
6. In order to use most of the functionality, you will need to be logged in. That was a constraint put as part of college's project rules. For credentials, check db.json.
