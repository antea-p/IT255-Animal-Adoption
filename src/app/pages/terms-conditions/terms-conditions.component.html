    <h2>Terms and Conditions</h2>
    <p>Hey there! Welcome to Animal Adoption Ltd.'s Symbolic Animal Adoption Program. Here, we've laid out the
        rules and guidelines for adopting animals via our website.</p>

    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>Just so you know, adopting an animal on our site is symbolic. It means you don't actually get to take home or
        look after a real animal.</p>

    <h3>2. Symbolic Adoption</h3>
    <p>
        When you symbolically adopt, you're throwing your support behind our animal conservation, care, and education
        initiatives.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Adoption Contribution</h3>
    <p>
        Your adoption contribution is actually a donation. Once made, it's not refundable. We use these funds to keep
        doing great work in animal care and conservation.
    </p>

    <h3>4. Adoption Certificate</h3>
    <p>With each symbolic adoption, you'll get a digital certificate. It's a nice keepsake but remember, it's just
        symbolic and doesn't mean you legally own or have rights over the animal.</p>

    <h3>5. Personal Information</h3>
    <p>Your privacy matters to us. We'll only use the personal info you provide during the adoption process to process
        the adoption itself. We promise not to hand it out to anyone else without your OK.</p>

    <h3>6. Limitation of Liability</h3>
    <p>Just a heads up, Animal Adoption Ltd. won't be on the hook for any direct or indirect issues, or any kind of
        damage that might come up from adopting with us.</p>

    <h3>7. Changes to Terms and Conditions</h3>
    <p>Occasionally, we might tweak these terms and conditions. You can always find the latest version on our website.
    </p>
